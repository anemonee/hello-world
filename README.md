Anemone is a plant and also an animal. The plant is one that grows wildflowers at the beginning of spring, and the animal 'anemone' is a beautiful coral-like creature that lives in the sea and is endangered. Apart from the fact that it is both a beautiful plant and animal, I love that the word anemone alternates with consonants and vowels.
